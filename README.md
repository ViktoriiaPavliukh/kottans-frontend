## Git basics
I've passed two weeks of coursera [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github). Everything is new for me in Git, it was very informative to watch these videos. 

I passed [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org) and finished all nesessary tasks for this level.
