## Git basics
I've passed two weeks of coursera [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github). Everything is new for me in Git, it was very informative to watch these videos. 

I passed [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org) and finished all nesessary tasks for this level.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

### Linux Survival (4 modules)
Information was very interesting, I learn a lot of things and hope one day I will use them on practice.
Below you can find print-screen of task succesfully passed:
